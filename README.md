DoomTAK
===

Ever find yourself out in the field with nothing better to do? Need a way to get those violent urges
out of your system without compromising your tactical awareness? Try DoomTAK! It's Doom, but in
ATAK!

Features
===

- Doom! - Specifically the shareware demo released by id Software. This means you only have the 9
  levels of the first chapter to work with, but I personally found them to be plenty. Try and
  compete with others for the best times!
- Buttons - A joystick to move and navigate menus, an interact/select button, a shoot/back button, a
  menu button, weapon selection buttons, and a fullscreen button (in case you value ergonomics over
  tactical awareness).
- No saves - Implementing saving would be quite a lot of work with how Android handles file
  permissions and such. Combined with the fact that the demo only has the first chapter of Doom,
  this seemed like more trouble than it was worth.
