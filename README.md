DoomTAK
===

Ever find yourself out in the field with nothing better to do? Need a way to get those urges for a mid 90's FPS
out of your system without compromising your tactical awareness? Try DoomTAK! It's Doom, but in
ATAK!

Features
===

- Doom! - Specifically the shareware demo released by id Software. This means you only have the 9
  levels of the first chapter to work with, but I personally found them to be plenty. Try and
  compete with others for the best times!
- Buttons - A joystick to move and navigate menus, an interact/select button, a shoot/back button, a
  menu button, weapon selection buttons, and a fullscreen button (in case you value ergonomics over
  tactical awareness).
- No saves - Implementing saving would be quite a lot of work with how Android handles file
  permissions and such. Combined with the fact that the demo only has the first chapter of Doom,
  this seemed like more trouble than it was worth.

Installation
===

- Install ATAK onto your phone if you don't have it already, taking note of the version. The
  simplest way to acquire it is from
  the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ).
- Download the DoomTAK APK from
  the [latest release](https://github.com/Xi-Systems-Ltd/DoomTAK/releases/latest) that corresponds
  to your version of ATAK (e.g. 5.2.0), then open it on your phone to install the plugin. If you
  acquired ATAK from Google Play Store then you should download the "civ-release" version. The
  "civ-debug" versions are for the developer build of ATAK found in the SDK.
